# CS2 Analytics — Current State

> Актуальная краткая сводка. Последняя точка продолжения находится в [SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md](SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md). При конфликте сначала проверь живой код, свежие сообщения владельца и checkpoint.

## Snapshot

- Date: 2026-11-14
- Repository: `nonspam/cs2-5x5`
- Working branch: `faceit-dev`
- Last branch HEAD checked before the memory-system update: `e13320fc8069fb78d650c0ff2ea01d3a1168acc0`
- Latest application implementation commit identified in the inspected recent history: `71dca4dcee8b0dca0092b3565735c54cb0011634`
- The commits after that implementation commit in the inspected history are documentation/project-memory journal updates.
- Latest recorded Quality Gate: [run 43631741156](https://github.com/nonspam/cs2-5x5/actions/runs/43631741156), 236 passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped (previously verified from job log). Re-check newer runs before relying on this.

## Product and architecture

CS2 Analytics is one integrated FACEIT-inspired application for the team's CS2 5×5 history, players, matches, maps, analytics, records, profiles and future competition systems. Do not create a parallel app.

- Vanilla JavaScript SPA.
- Main runtime: `app_v57.js`.
- Main styles: `style_v57.css`.
- Account/profile module: `account_module.js`.
- ELO implementation: `elo_v3.js`.
- Automated tests: `tests/*.test.cjs`.
- Quality Gate: `npm run check` via GitHub Actions.
- Make scoped changes; do not rewrite the monolith wholesale.

## Current focus

See [SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md](SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md) for the exact active task and next action.

As of the latest owner feedback recorded on 2026-11-14, the active refinement is the FACEIT-style Match Room window: the underlying site's left navigation should remain visible rather than the whole application becoming excessively dark when a match opens. The owner is providing newer messages/screenshots to clarify the exact visual target. Do not treat this as completed or visually verified.

A related recent visual note says the Match Overview MVP player position may need a small rightward adjustment; confirm against the owner's newest screenshots before changing it.

## Confirmed implementation baseline

- Profile opens in a contained window reusing the existing profile renderer; vertical navigation: Overview, Match History, Track, Close.
- Match Room uses a contained workspace window intended to preserve the desktop global left rail.
- Both windows use full-screen behavior at widths up to 700px.
- Relevant source files: `app_v57.js`, `style_v57.css`; regression tests: `tests/faceit-v2-shell.test.cjs`.
- Implementation commit: `71dca4dcee8b0dca0092b3565735c54cb0011634`.

## Verification boundaries

- Automated Quality Gate evidence exists as listed above.
- Browser visual/interaction QA: not evidenced in the latest recorded checkpoint.
- Screenshot comparison: not evidenced.
- DEV deployment verification: not evidenced.
- Production deployment: not evidenced.
- Do not claim visual acceptance or deployment based on CI.

## Safety and unresolved areas

- Work only on `faceit-dev` unless the owner explicitly authorizes otherwise.
- No production, database, SQL, migrations, RLS, grants or Edge Function changes without separate explicit permission.
- Do not deploy or perform browser QA without separate explicit permission.
- Preserve real project data and existing functions during UI work.
- Do not infer unresolved ELO/series/roster semantics; consult the technical decision documents before touching them.

## Continuation

1. Read SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md.
2. Check live faceit-dev HEAD and commits again.
3. Incorporate the owner's newest screenshots/messages.
4. Inspect current source and relevant regression tests.
5. Continue only the current approved task.
6. Update SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md after each logical stage and before ending the chat.
